====================
PISA Project
====================

This module extends Odoo's Project application to support custom workflows and permissions for PISA projects.

Key Features
============
- Introduces a new 'Manager' group with specific access rights and record rules.
- Team managers can fully manage their own projects and related records (stages, tasks, tags, milestones, collaborators, and analytic accounts).
- Project managers can only view and manage the projects they have created, ensuring data privacy and responsibility.

Usage
=====
1. Install the module as usual from the Apps menu.
2. Assign users to the 'Project/Manager' group to grant them project management rights.
3. Project managers will only see and manage projects they have created.

Bug Tracker
===========
